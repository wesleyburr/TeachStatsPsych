## Reproducibility 

In this workshop, I am specifically interested in discussing ways in which to encourage
students to develop strong reproducible research **methods**, particularly with 
respect to their data gathering, manipulation, and analysis.

<br/>
I will gratefully leave the discussions of specific issues in general reproducibility
in the psychological sciences to domain experts.

## Reproducible Research Methods

First published work I could find that referenced the specific framework I am
thinking of here (computational reproducibility) is 1992:

<br/>

J. Claerbout, M. Karrenbach, **Electronic documents give reproducible research a new meaning**, in Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics, New Orleans, USA, 25 to 29 October 1992.

## Reproducible Research Methods

Some quotes:

<br/>
* *a revolution in education and technology transfer follows from the marriage of word processing and software command scripts*
* *researchers ... can reproduce their own research results a year or more later by "pressing a single button"*
* *Our basic goal is reproducible research. The electronic document is our means to this end*

## Definition

<br/>
... the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.
**This is the essential part of open science.**

## Some Necessary Components

To make any research project computationally reproducible

* all data and files clearly:
    - separated
    - labelled
    - documented
* all operations should be automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention 
* workflow designed as a sequence of steps (scripts!), combined so intermediate outputs from one step directly feed in as inputs to the next
* version control should be used

class: inverse

## Workflow Includes

* data acquisition
* data processing
    - entry
    - manipulation
    - filtering
* data analysis
    - computation of statistics
    - figures
    - model-fitting (including interim steps!) - avoid The Garden of Forking Paths!
    - linear flow, resist urge to modify earlier steps (PHARKing)
* actually software engineering!
