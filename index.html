# Background: Reproducibility




---

class: inverse

## Reproducibility 

In this talk, I am specifically interested in discussing ways in which to encourage
students to develop skills and habits for strong reproducible research *methods*, particularly with 
respect to their data gathering, manipulation, and analysis.

&lt;br/&gt;
I will gratefully leave the discussions of specific issues in general reproducibility
in the psychological sciences to domain experts (like Chris this morning!).

## Reproducible Research Methods

First published work I am aware of that discusses the specific framework I am
thinking of (computational reproducibility) is 1990-92, J. Claerbout 
at Stanford:

&lt;br/&gt;

J. Claerbout, M. Karrenbach, *Electronic documents give reproducible research a new meaning*, in Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics, New Orleans, USA, 25 to 29 October 1992.

## Reproducible Research Methods

Some quotes:

&lt;br/&gt;
- a revolution in education and technology transfer follows from the marriage of word processing and software command scripts

--

- researchers ... can reproduce their own research results a year or more later by "pressing a single button"

--

- Our basic goal is reproducible research. The electronic document is our means to this end

&lt;br/&gt;
https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162

---



## Definition

&lt;br/&gt;
... the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.
**This is the essential part of open science.**

&lt;br/&gt;
*Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility*

---



## Some Necessary Components

To make any research project computationally reproducible

- all data and files clearly: separated; labelled; documented
    
--

- all operations should be automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention 

--

- workflow designed as a sequence of steps (**scripts!**), combined so intermediate outputs from one step directly feed in as inputs to the next

--

- version control should be used

---

## Workflow Includes

- data acquisition

--

- data processing
    - entry
    - manipulation
    - filtering

--

- data analysis
    - computation of statistics
    - figures
    - model-fitting (including interim steps!) - avoid The Garden of Forking Paths!
    - linear flow, resist urge to modify earlier steps (HARKing)

---

## Researcher Point of View

I strongly endorse **Data Carpentry**, workshops teaching scientists
basic skills in this sort of thinking.

&lt;br/&gt;
Even if you don't do this kind of process for your research (and if you do statistics,
you *should*!), if you expect to teach it properly, you have to know how to do it! 

&lt;br/&gt;
*Physician, heal thyself*

## Tips for Getting Started in Small Ways

- force yourself to organize your course materials in a coherent manner

--

- use Git to store your course materials (make them available freely!)

--

- create your slides in R Markdown or an equivalent

--

- integrate software into *lectures* and the classroom, not only labs and workshops

--

- always be learning!

## Inspiration

File organization and naming
are powerful weapons against chaos.

Your closest collaborator is you six months ago,
but you don’t reply to emails.

## Basic Principles

Basic principles

Step 1: slow down and document.&lt;br/&gt;
Step 2: have sympathy for your future self.&lt;br/&gt;
Step 3: have a system.&lt;br/&gt;

# Translating All of This to Teaching

---

class: inverse

## What Not to Do

- use "mathiness"

--

- use *lookup tables* for quantiles

--

- teach Excel
    - Excel is *not* a tool for science. [Period](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00180-014-0482-5)

--

- teach the menu-driven system (e.g., SPSS, Stata *menus*)
    - while powerful, not reproducible - teaches bad habits!
    - if using these platforms, force scripting

---

class: inverse

## What Not to Do

- use bad (horribly out of date) code or examples

--

    - the world of data analysis and scientific data management is changing rapidly
    - anything more than 5 years old is out of date
    - students can tell

--

- use only examples that are small enough to type out manually

--

    - misleading, hides where the work may be
    - get bigger data sets in: with File Input/Output, it's just as easy to do
    
---

class: inverse

## What Not to Do

- use (fully) clean data (next slides)

--

    - misleading, hides the nitty gritty
    - include some outliers, include some syntax errors
    - force students to confront the reality

# R Markdown

---

class: inverse

## Context and Motivation

When doing lab work, you:

- use notebooks to

--

    - organize methods
    - organize and record results
    - jot down conclusions

--

- convert these notebooks into Methods sections for papers

---

class: inverse

## Context and Motivation

When working computationally, you *should* do the same thing!

- data provenance

--

- detailed log of workflow

--

- tools used at each step

--

- parameters ("researcher degrees of freedom") recorded

--

- versioning for software

---

class: inverse

## What does this mean?

- students need to access the majority of these components within their
first course

--

- can't hide it all away and trust they'll pick it up later

--

- immersion and support!

&lt;br/&gt;

--

Traditionally (e.g., 2005-2015), if we wanted to include R in an introductory
course, this meant dealing with the (horrible) R GUI (or something like R Commander).
Teaching students to code from the start. Jumping into the deep end with sharks.

---

## The Computational Notebook (with Markdown!)

Now, for both R and Python, **notebooks** exist. These are computational
representations of the traditional lab notebook, freely mixing:

## The Computational Notebook (with Markdown!)

Now, for both R and Python, **notebooks** exist. These are computational
representations of the traditional lab notebook, freely mixing:

- text

--

- code (replaces math)

--

- figures (replaces diagrams)

--

- analysis

--

- results

Additionally, when run as a document instead of an interactive notebook,
the framework is set up to **force** reproducibility through
the action of **knitting**.

## Advantages


```r
x &lt;- rnorm(100)
y &lt;- rnorm(100)
m &lt;- mean(x)
m
```

```
[1] -0.241098
```

The code and results are right there!

---



## Advantages


```r
plot(x = x, y = y)
```

![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

Figures and graphs are right there, with their code!

---



## Advantages


```r
mod &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = data.frame(x, y))
plot(x = x, y = y)
abline(mod, col = "red")
```

![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

Run models, syntax is immediate, researcher decisions are clear.

---

class: inverse

## Advantages

- forces students to think about workflow

--

- integrates all decisions into one place

--

- teaches coding skills by "stealth" (osmosis: template, scaffold, expose)

--

- is actually how most researchers work: no baby software or apps

--

- infinitely extensible

--

- supported by the R ecosystem and CRAN

---

# An Implementation

---

class: inverse

## MATH 1051H and 1052H

- large introductory statistics classes for science majors

--

- 650 and 450 students, respectively

--

- students tend to not have calculus backgrounds

--

- students **definitely** do not have computer science background

---

class: inverse

## Structure

- weekly workshops, with pre-written R Markdown documents, stepped through in real-time
with qualified TAs

--

- challenge problems and learnR tutorials for additional learning

--

- weekly WeBWorK self-graded assignments, mixing multiple choice, theory, and questions
which **require** the use of R to complete

--

- four assignments per term, turned in as knit R Markdown PDFs, stepping through
required skills (hand graded)

--

- R code chunks included in lectures weekly, discussed

--

- osmosis, osmosis, osmosis

---

class: inverse

## Side Effects / Downsides

- tech support in the first week of term is complete chaos (used rstudio.cloud for
a time: amazing product. Too expensive at the moment. Very sad)

--

- learning curve in the first four weeks is steep

--

- students must be supported and encouraged, and grading must be generous to start

--

- absolutely need qualified, tuned-in TAs. You cannot use arbitrary graduate students
who don't walk the walk / talk the talk (I train my own TAs from undergraduates who
have taken the courses earlier in their degrees)

---

class: inverse

## Results

- the vast majority (80%+) of students engage and learn

--

- students are able (by the end of first semester) to create professional R Markdown knit documents, with fully worked analyses of scientific data 

--

   - load data files
   - examine data for abnormalities
   - plot exploratory analyses
   - compute simple statistical models
   - perform hypothesis testing (NHST)
   - generate confidence intervals
   - produce quality plots
 
---

class: inverse

## Results

By the end of the second semester, students can successfully complete
the following in R, using R Markdown documents:

--

- all of the above

--

- load a variety of data set formats

--

- linear and multiple linear regression

--

- one and two-way additive ANOVA

--

- interactions, with plots and discussion

--

- post hoc testing

--

- a broad spectrum of hypothesis tests

--

- permutation testing

--

- standard array of plotting techniques

## Musings

- Bias: I'm a statistician, and work with (and write) software every day of my professional life

--

- However ...
    - software is [eating the world!](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)
    - we **owe** it to our students to prepare them to use the actual tools of science
    - even if it's uncomfortable for us, we have to adapt and change and grow: 
    the **current** best practices will not be the same in 5, 10, 20 years

--

- This approach **works** for novices!

--

- It's amazing to see what they can do by the end of the year!

---

# Self Training

---

class: inverse

## Encouragement

- I want to encourage you all to consider trying to integrate RStudio and R Markdown into your courses

--

- Make sure you do it in a way which is actually modern (not 10 years out of date) - students can tell

--

- It has to be integrated and seamless - a bolt-on will never work

--

- Leverage the "big data movement" to bring examples beyond the scope of the course into the classroom to inspire and excite the students

--

- Always be learning!
